## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Voice Assistants and IVR Systems

Voice assistants have revolutionized the way we interact with technology. These smart companions can understand and respond to natural language, making interactions more human-like and intuitive. IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems are an integral part of voice assistants, allowing users to interact via phone calls. IVR systems greet callers with pre-recorded messages and present menu options, enabling users to navigate through the system using voice commands. The combination of voice assistants and IVR systems enhances accessibility, making it easier for users to retrieve information and perform tasks through simple voice interactions.

---

### 2.2 Information Retrieval with Chatbot Technology

Chatbots have become ubiquitous across various platforms, offering real-time conversation capabilities. Information retrieval is a key application of chatbot technology, enabling users to obtain relevant information by asking questions in natural language. By leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, chatbots can understand user intent and provide contextually accurate responses. Chatbots have evolved to offer sophisticated information retrieval, ranging from real-time data, weather updates, to historical facts. Their ability to engage in interactive dialogues with users makes them valuable tools for accessing information on-the-go.

---

### 2.3 The Role of Speech-to-Text Transcription in IVR Applications

In IVR applications, speech-to-text transcription plays a pivotal role in enabling seamless interactions between users and the system. When users make voice calls, the speech-to-text technology converts spoken words into written text, allowing IVR systems to process and understand user queries. This transformation from voice to text bridges the gap between spoken language and digital systems, facilitating the extraction of meaning from audio inputs. Accurate and efficient speech-to-text transcription ensures a smooth user experience and forms the backbone of effective IVR-based information retrieval.

---

### 2.4 OpenAI's ChatGPT or BARD's API and its Applications

OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's BARD API are powerful language models that have redefined natural language understanding and generation. ChatGPT is adept at engaging in contextual conversations and providing informative responses. BARD, on the other hand, excels in real-time querying, delivering dynamic information based on user input. These language models have found versatile applications in various domains, including content generation, customer support, and information retrieval. Integrating ChatGPT and BARD with IVR systems elevates the intelligence and responsiveness of voice assistants, empowering users with accurate and meaningful information retrieval through phone calls.

---

### 2.5 Twilio's Communication Platform and its Integration with IVR Systems

Twilio's Communication Platform is renowned for its capabilities in enabling voice and messaging services. With Twilio, developers can build IVR systems that handle incoming calls, direct callers through menu options, and gather information using voice responses. The platform seamlessly integrates with IVR applications, enabling dynamic call routing and personalized responses. Twilio's flexibility and scalability make it an ideal choice for implementing IVR-based voice assistants like Saarthi, empowering businesses and developers to deliver interactive and efficient communication solutions.

### 9.1 Code Snippets for Flask Application Setup:

The following code snippets illustrate the setup of the Flask application to deploy Saarthi:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, url_for, render_template, redirect
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import Gather, VoiceResponse
from twilio.rest import Client
import openai
import urllib.request
import random
import os
from langdetect import detect

app = Flask(__name__)

# Class for Saarthi application
class SaarthiApp:
    def __init__(self):
        # Twilio account SID and authentication token
        self.account_sid = os.getenv('ACCOUNT_SID')
        self.auth_token = os.getenv('AUTH_TOKEN')
        self.openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API')  # OpenAI API key

        self.client = Client(self.account_sid, self.auth_token)
        self.messages = []

    # Method to initiate a phone call using Twilio Client API
    def make_call(self, number):
        record_url = url_for("record", _external=True)
        call = self.client.calls.create(
            to="+91" + number,
            from_="+14067177408",
            url=record_url
        )
        print(call.sid)

    # Method to transcribe the audio recording using OpenAI Whisper API
    def transcribe(self, recording_url):
        hash = str(random.getrandbits(32))
        try:
            urllib.request.urlretrieve(recording_url, hash + ".wav")
        except:
            return None
        openai.api_key = self.openai_api_key

        # Transcribing the audio
        audio_file = open(hash + ".wav", "rb")
        transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)

        # Deleting the audio file after transcription
        os.remove(hash + ".wav")
        return transcript

saarthi_app = SaarthiApp()
```

---

### 9.2 Customization Examples for Voice Prompts:

You can easily customize the voice prompts by modifying the respective TwiML responses in the `main.py` file. Here are some examples:

```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    # Custom welcome message
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/record", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def record():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    # Custom voice prompt before recording
    response.say("Please leave a message after the beep.")
    response.record(action='/handle-recording', finish_on_key='*')
    return str(response)  
```

In order to tweak the responses over the Saarthi, you can modify the prompt of CHAT completions:

```python
